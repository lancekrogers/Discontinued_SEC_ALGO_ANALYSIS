#This project was built for the development of an automated trading system that has been discontinued
<p>
The goal of this project was to build an automated system that would analyze SEC filings as they were filed and make a decision to buy or sell based on historical results.
This project has not been worked on since January 2017 and the FTP server used by the edgardb library has been turned off by the SEC and the library has not been updated.  There are no current plans to continue the development of this project and it is solely on github for future reference purposes.
