<h1>These notebooks and files were used in the development of an automated trading system that has since been discontinued and are solely for future reference purposes</h1>
<p>
The goal of this system was to have a bot monitoring the SEC server, analyze companies filings as they were filed, identify mispriced securities and make a trading decision based on 2 to 3 month outlook.  As of right now there are no plans to continue this project, but that may change in the future.
